In the above example int i=0 refers to initialization of while loop.\n2. Increment/Decrement\ni++ refers to increment/decrement\nwhile(i<10) refers to the termination of while loop. Each time the while loop executed, it checks for condition whether the value of i is less than 10 or not.\nf the value of i is less than 10, the loop will be executed and increment i by one and then print the value of i\n3. Termination.\n When the value of i reaches 10, the while(i<10) condition becomes false and terminates the loop."
